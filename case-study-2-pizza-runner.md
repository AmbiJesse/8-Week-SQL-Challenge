### Problem Statement
Danny wants to Uberize pizza. He recruiters 'runners' to deliver fresh pizza and built a mobile app to accept orders from customers. He has prepared an ERD of his database design that requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimize Pizza Runner's operations.
