# 8 Week SQL Challenge
Danny Ma's [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) includes 8 case studies in health analytics, marketing analytics, people analytics, financial markets, consumer goods, and digital marketing.

### Topics Required to Solve Problems: 
`Common Table Expressions and Subqueries`, `Complex Table Joins`, `Entity Relationship Diagrams`, `Window Functions`, `Case When`, `Recursive CTEs`, `Cumulative Aggregates`, `Ranking`, `Simple, Weighted, Exponential Moving Metrics`, `Temporary Tables`, `String Transformation`, `Impact of Indexes`, `Table Schemas`

### PostgreSQL Server
To solve the case studies, I set up my own PostgreSQL server to host the tables provided in each challenge. I installed SQLalchemy in JupyterLab to form a database connection and to use it as my SQL editor.
