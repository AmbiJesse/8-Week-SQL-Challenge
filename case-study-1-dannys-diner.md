### Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they've spent and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers. He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program.

## Solutions
There are 10 questions to be answers and solved using SQL.

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```SQL
select customer_id, sum(price) as total_spent
from dannys_diner.sales as s
inner join dannys_diner.menu as m
  using(product_id)
group by customer_id
order by total_spent desc;
```
Result:
| customer_id | total_spent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A | 76 |
| B | 74 |
| C | 36 |

- Customer A spent the most at $76, Customer B spent $74 and Customer C spent $36.
---
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
```SQL
select customer_id, count(distinct order_date) as visit_count
from dannys_diner.sales
group by customer_id
order by visit_count desc;
```
Result:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| B | 6 |
| A | 4 |
| C | 2 |

- Utilized `distinct` to avoid duplicates of multiple orders made on the same day.
- Ordered results in descending order to see customers who visit the most, first.
