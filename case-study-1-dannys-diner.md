### Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they've spent and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers. He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program.

## Solutions
There are 10 questions to be answered and solved using SQL.

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```SQL
select customer_id, sum(price) as total_spent
from dannys_diner.sales as s
inner join dannys_diner.menu as m
    using(product_id)
group by customer_id
order by total_spent desc;
```
Result:
| customer_id | total_spent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A | 76 |
| B | 74 |
| C | 36 |

- Customer A spent the most at $76, Customer B spent $74 and Customer C spent $36.
---
**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
```SQL
select customer_id, count(distinct order_date) as visit_count
from dannys_diner.sales
group by customer_id
order by visit_count desc;
```
Result:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| B | 6 |
| A | 4 |
| C | 2 |

- Utilized `distinct` to avoid duplicates of multiple orders made on the same day.
- Ordered results in descending order to see customers who visit the most, first.

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
```SQL
with order_sequence as (
    select
        customer_id,
        order_date,
        product_name,
        dense_rank() over(partition by customer_id
                          order by order_date) as rank
    from dannys_diner.sales
    inner join dannys_diner.menu using(product_id)
)
select
    customer_id,
    product_name as first_item_ordered
from order_sequence
where rank = 1
group by customer_id, product_name
order by customer_id;
```
Result:
| customer_id | first_item_ordered |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A | curry |
| A | sushi |
| B | curry |
| C | ramen |

- Used a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `order_sequence` to `rank` the order_dates sequentially to filter for the first orders made.
- With data limitations of context for orders made on the same day, `dense_rank` is used to categorize both items purchased for Customer A as their first item(s) ordered. The data states that Customer A ordered curry and sushi on `2021-01-01`.

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
```SQL
select
    product_name,
    count(s.product_id) as order_count
from dannys_diner.sales as s
inner join dannys_diner.menu as m using(product_id)
group by product_name
order by order_count desc
limit 1;
```
Result:
| product_name | order_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ramen | 8 |

- Used `count` to aggregate the number of `product_id`s present in every sale, grouped by the menu item name, and ordered by the `order_count` to find that ramen was ordered by all the customers eight times.
---
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
```SQL
select
```
---
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
```SQL
select
```
---
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
```SQL
select
```
---
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
```SQL
select
```
---
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
```SQL
select
```
---
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
```SQL
select
```
